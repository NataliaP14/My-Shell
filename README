# Custom Shell (`mysh`)

This is a basic custom shell implementation in C that supports:

- Interactive and batch modes  
- Command parsing and execution  
- Input/output redirection (`<`, `>`)  
- Pipes (`|`) â€“ single pipe only  
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`)  
- Wildcard expansion (e.g., `*`)  
- Built-in commands support (assumed implemented elsewhere)  
- Executable script launching
